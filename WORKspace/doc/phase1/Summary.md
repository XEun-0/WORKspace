#### Goal
Create a browser extension for Mozilla Firefox in order to manage tasks and the associated links together into "blocks".

#### Elaboration
With brownsers being one of the most commonly opened apps as well being the longest left open on most people's computers, I wanted to create an extension that allows diverse customization in being able to organize tasks as well as the sites and tabs associated with that task.
Due to personal experience, it seems that opening many tabs is not a trait found in few, but rather a large majority. With this comes the organization and also searching the tab you felt had relevance to the task at hand.
What I want to create is a tab that has sections called "blocks" that users can assign with name and color that would allow users to add tabs as well as a task-tracker like module with a checkoff list.
The task-tracker like module would also have features included in it such as due date and time.

#### Intended Audience
WORKspace is intended for people who find themselves diving into workloads that include extensive browser searching or information retrieval.
